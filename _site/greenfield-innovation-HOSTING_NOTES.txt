Hi,
I would like CNAME greenfieldinnovation.com to point to "greenfield-innovation.github.io". Eventually, I'd like "www" to redirect to "greenfieldinnovation.com". Other parts of the site may have subdomains at a later date, e.g. "blog.*", and they may not be powered by GitHub. So, I suspect I do not want "*" (wildcard), correct?

Repro steps
=========
Config page: https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/dns/greenfieldinnovation.com
Add entry of type "CNAME".
Hostname ?	Type ?	Value ?	TTL ?	

The tooltip on Hostname reads "Add a subdomain (www or blog) or leave empty for the root/naked domain. Hostnames can start with '*' for wildcard matches." The form field hint / placeholder reads "e.g. www, blog or leave empty".

However, when I submit with it empty, validation reads "field is required". 

As a result, I was able to configure "www.greenfieldinnovation.com", but not "greenfieldinnovation.com".
How do I accomplish this? Do I need to type a pair of double quotes to represent empty string?

Thanks,
Monte
