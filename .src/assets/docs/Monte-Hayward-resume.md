* Portable giving form
    - Any customer can paste a single-line snippet into their Web page. Upon page load, this JavaScript client "wakes up", finds its location, and inserts a form. The form takes donations and event registrations in the context of the customer brand and page.
* Advocacy workflows
    - People sign themselves up, and then may show support by placing a form snippet on their site or blog, and emailing personalized links. Viral advocacy supports the core Kimbia principle: Personal relationships motivate people to donate and sign up. The form is viral, so, the power of giving is pushed out to the very edges of a network of advocates, enabling geometric expansion.
* Mixin components
    - Conditional questions, complex validation, custom script events, and payment plans support a highly configurable experience.
* Ancillary widgets
    - Reporting, lookup, payment plan self-service, and others round out the suite.
