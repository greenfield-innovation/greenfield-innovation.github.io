## Challenge

* Portable forms had already increased donations
* Needed new ways to motivate giving
* Required feature parity in fundraising teams

## Approach
I recalled how sharing personal stories had motivated content authorship at a prior startup.
I suggested that we let donors tell others *why* they give.
At the very moment someone was motivated to give money, provide ways for them to enlist others.
This began with a set of social links, and grew to become personalized appeals for giving.

### Single Page Application: Advocate Center

* Author personal statement about a cause
* Upload photos and video
* Invite others to give and join teams
* Edit personal profile at any time

<div class="flip-container" ontouchstart="this.classList.toggle('hover');">
  <div class="flipper">
    <div class="front" style="background-image: url(/assets/examples/innovative/profile-editor.png)"></div>
    <div class="back" style="background-image: url(/assets/examples/innovative/profile-editor-js.png)"></div>
  </div>
</div>


### Personalization Components

* Components deliver personal appeal in giving context
* Any page composition with components for:
  - Generic Form
  - Personal Photo or Video
  - Statement
  - Fundraising goal and progress
* Special identifier activates personal components
* Option to join team and donate

## Results

* Record levels of giving

<div class="flip-container" ontouchstart="this.classList.toggle('hover');" style="height:1357px;">
  <div class="flipper">
    <div class="front" style="background-image: url(/assets/examples/secure/form-app.png); height:1357px;" title="Personalized Giving Form" alt="Personalized Giving Form"></div>
    <div class="back" style="background-image: url(/assets/examples/secure/form-app-js.png); height:1357px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>
