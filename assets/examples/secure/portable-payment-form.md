## Challenge
* Form was portable, with limited features
* Code was procedural, and delivered with data
* Competitor forms were isolated in a unfamiliar hosted environment


## Approach
* Decompose form into MVC components
* Add customizable branding
* Enhance validation and rulesets
* Deliver separately from configuration
* Establish a broad matrix of supported browsers
* Share form via click, copy and paste

## Results
* Concurrent rapid development iterations
* Form user always in context with branding
* Streamlined form completion
* Faster load times
* Core support for browsers more than a decade old
* Rapid form sharing supports disaster response
