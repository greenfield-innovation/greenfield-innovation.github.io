Reduce your time-to-market with veteran development-on-demand.

### UX-driven Invention
Developer career devoted to the display layer, where human interaction occurs.

###	Reduced Time-To-Market
Realize your vision and enjoy early mover status. 

###	Proven Market Disruptor
Put a fiercely independent thinker onto your team. Someone who will challenge conventional assumptions and short-circuit inefficiencies.

### Top-Notch Requirements and Documentation
A well-written and spoken individual comprehends your vision quickly, writes crisp requirements, and enjoys feedback.

###	Easy Collaboration and Handoff
Generous with ideas and knowledge-sharing, encouraging a Shared Mental Model and organizational success.

###	Rapid Prototyping
Collaboration becomes more productive when people can try the experience and react directly. Ideas convey faster and with fewer words, to your internal team and external prospects.

##	Your Secret Weapon

###	20 Years Startup Experience
Get to sustainable, scalable and novel inventions with less ramp-up time. Ingrained integrity you can trust.

###	Pitfall Avoidance
Familiarity with patterns and antipatterns means you will save time that would otherwise go to common mistakes.

###Core Contrarian
There is no IP or disruptive advantage in approaching your core business in a conventional fashion. It is in our nature to challenge and beat the status quo.

###	Full-stack, UX-First
Where does a product differentiate itself? Where are features coveted and hotly debated? In the experience layer. Take advantage of the ability to think experience-first, and develop toward the back end. Greenfield Innovation naturally begins with the desired interaction and display, proceeds to define the API layer, and then envisions supportive back end solutions.
