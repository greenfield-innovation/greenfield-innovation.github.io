# PCI Preflight Checks
* End-to-end examination of systems, deployment and hosting

    * [Visa Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP)](//usa.visa.com/merchants/protect-your-business/cisp/)
    * [MasterCard Site Data Protection (SDP)](//www.mastercard.com/sdp)
* Identify which documents can be shared in response to inquiries

Typically, the first year of [PCI compliance](//www.pcisecuritystandards.org) auditing is the toughest. In subsequent years, many of the answers are boilerplate, unless your system design changes. QSAs also like to add a few spot checks each year. gig can also help companies that need to bring their systems up to date with the latest [PCI DSS 3.0](//www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3_Summary_of_Changes.pdf) standard.

## Apply for CISP and SDP
The card provider lists [(Visa CISP)](//usa.visa.com/merchants/protect-your-business/cisp/) and [(Mastercard SDP)](//www.mastercard.com/sdp) offer a designation separate from, not required for, PCI compliance. Yet, they are regarded as the gold standard by many business partners and clients. Having your company listed publicly by Visa or MasterCard tends to shorten inquiries. You can always decide whether to apply for these programs after your Report On Compliance (ROC) has been accepted.
